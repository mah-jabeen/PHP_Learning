<?php

// function of array 
// array range(start,end,step)
// for suppose we give it 1 and 5 and we want range in between of it and we will use range function 
// step by default value is 1, its optional to give it
// it also works on characters 

// $newarray = range(1,10,2);

// print_r($newarray); 

// you can also use it in foreach loop
// foreach(range('a','k') as $letter) {
//     echo''.$letter.'';
// }

// explode and implode function of an array
// explode(seperator,string,limit) if we want to convert a string value in an array
// limit is optional parameter it works as whatever we give value is limit it will  make that many indexes of array

// implode(seperator,array) if you want to convert an array into a string
// there is one function similar to implode that is join, no difference in between both
